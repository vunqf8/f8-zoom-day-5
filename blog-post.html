          <p>I didn’t have a business plan when I left corporate America and launched my career as a self-employed software development consultant and trainer. Eventually I came up with an appealing business objective: Earn a living while I’m asleep. That lofty objective then forced the question, “How am I going to do that?”</p>
          <p>As an independent sole proprietor, every penny of revenue came through my personal efforts. The trick was to figure out how to generate as much income as possible with little effort. I came up with several ways to generate ongoing passive income streams after some initial investment of effort. Collectively, these have yielded more than six figures of revenue for quite a few years. Perhaps some of these seven ideas will work for you.</p>
          <h3>Income While You Sleep #1: Book Royalties</h3>
          <p>Book royalties are a gift that can keep on giving, with some caveats. Follow this simple procedure:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><a href="">Write a book.</a> After authoring fourteen books, I can tell you that this is not trivial.</li>
            <li>Make sure it’s a good book. Ideally, it will accrue many positive reviews, and readers will recognize the contribution it makes to the practitioners in your field.</li>
            <li>Make sure the book fills an important niche in the literature of your domain. I typically identified gaps in the software literature and attempted to plug them, with quite good results. It’s best if your topic doesn’t face a lot of competition or if you have something innovative and unique to say.</li>
            <li>Tell people about the book. This generally means going with an established, traditional publisher rather than self-publishing. You won’t get as much money per copy that way, but you certainly will sell more copies. Expect to spend a lot of effort on promotion, no matter how your book is published.</li>
            <li>Write a book that has a long shelf life, not one that deals with the latest fad in your field or with a technology that will be obsolete in a year.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Don’t expect to live on your royalties, as few technical and professional books sell zillions of copies. My most popular book, Software Requirements, had sold about 140,000 copies in three editions over 25 years. That's very good for a technical book. I know a handful of people who make $100,000 or more a year from book royalties. I’ve never approached that lofty pinnacle myself. You would be surprised at how little authors make per copy. Nonetheless, they do add up.</p>
          <p>Once the book is conceived, planned, outlined, proposed to a publisher, contracted, written, reviewed, revised, edited, proofread, published, and promoted, all you have to do is cash the royalty checks. What could be easier?</p>
          <h3>Income While You Sleep #2: Online Writing</h3>
          <p>I now have more than 180 articles posted on my Medium.com account, on a wide range of topics. I’m enrolled in Medium’s Partner Program, which places my articles behind Medium’s paywall. Each time someone views an article or interacts with it through clapping, highlighting, responding, or following me, I get a penny or two (literally). In theory, as long as an article remains posted, someone might read it. The pennies continue to trickle in, and they add up.</p>
          <p>The algorithm that Medium uses to calculate revenue is obscure. I can have two articles with similar access statistics that vary considerably in earnings. It’s a mystery. Some of my articles have drawn more than 20,000 views; others have drawn just a few dozen. I’ve found that the significant lifetime of an article is only a few days. I’ll get a lot of viewers shortly after posting a new piece, but the traffic soon declines considerably. Yet the income trickle continues.</p>
          <p>There are other platforms for posting your writing or other media content online and perhaps generating some income, such as Substack. Don’t expect to live on the revenue, but posting your writing shares your knowledge, increases your visibility, and passively markets your skills and services.</p>
